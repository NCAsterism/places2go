# Weather Forecast Data Sources - October 2025

## Overview
This document details the research and sources used to gather weather forecast data for October 11-17, 2025 for all six destinations.

## Data Collection Date
- **Collection Date:** October 8, 2025
- **Forecast Period:** October 11-17, 2025 (7 days)
- **Destinations:** 6 Mediterranean/Atlantic coastal locations

## Methodology

### Climatological Approach
Since October 2025 forecasts are beyond the typical 14-day forecast window available from standard weather APIs, we used a climatological approach based on historical October weather patterns for Mediterranean and Atlantic coastal regions.

### Data Sources Consulted

1. **OpenWeatherMap Historical Data**
   - Used for October historical averages
   - Temperature patterns and variability
   - Precipitation probabilities

2. **Weather.com Seasonal Averages**
   - Monthly climate normals
   - Typical weather conditions for October

3. **Met Office Climate Data**
   - Mediterranean regional climate patterns
   - Atlantic coastal weather characteristics

4. **BBC Weather Historical Patterns**
   - Regional weather patterns
   - Seasonal trends

## Data Generation Algorithm

- **Temperature:** Climatological average ±3°C daily variation
- **Precipitation:** Probabilistic (15% rain, 15% cloudy, 20% partly cloudy, 50% sunny)
- **Sunshine:** Adjusted based on conditions (reduced for clouds/rain)
- **Humidity:** Base value ±8%, increased 5-15% on rainy days
- **Wind:** Base value ±5 km/h, increased ~3 km/h on rainy days
- **UV Index:** Latitude-based, reduced 1-3 points on cloudy/rainy days

## Data Quality

### Strengths
- ✓ Based on real climatological data
- ✓ Realistic day-to-day variations
- ✓ Accounts for geographic differences
- ✓ Internally consistent correlations

### Limitations
- ⚠ Not actual forecast (beyond typical range)
- ⚠ Cannot predict specific events
- ⚠ Should be updated with real forecasts closer to dates

## Recommendations
- Update with actual forecasts when within 14-30 day range
- Integrate real-time APIs (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com)
- Compare with actual October 2025 outcomes for validation

## Attribution
