## Key Improvements from Phase 2 Lessons

### Problems We Solved

| Phase 2 Issue | Root Cause | Phase 3 Solution |
|---------------|------------|------------------|
| Merge conflicts in 5+ PRs | All PRs modified dashboard.py | Modularize into smaller files |
| Bad merge (conflict markers) | Insufficient verification | Always grep for `<<<<<<<` after merge |
| Bot PR conflicts | Overlapping changes | Review bot PRs carefully, close if complex |
| Large PRs hard to review | Tried to do too much | Keep PRs < 200 lines, one purpose each |
| Documentation scattered | Organic growth | Organized docs/ structure |

### Process Improvements

**Before Phase 3:**
1. ✅ Review [PR Best Practices](docs/PR_BEST_PRACTICES.md)
2. ✅ Follow sequential merging for overlapping changes
3. ✅ Keep PRs small and focused (< 200 lines)
4. ✅ Always test locally before merging
5. ✅ Check for conflict markers after every merge

**Project Structure:**
- Moving phase docs to `docs/project/`
- Creating `docs/architecture/`, `docs/processes/`, `docs/development/`
- Splitting `scripts/dashboard.py` into modules
- Separating data into logical CSV files

---

## New Data Structure Design

### Current (v1.0)
```
data/
  dummy_data.csv  # Everything mixed together
```

### Proposed (v2.0)
```
data/
  destinations/
    destinations.csv      # Static: name, country, coordinates, airport
    cost_of_living.csv    # Semi-static: rent, food, utilities (updated quarterly)
  flights/
    flight_prices.csv     # Dynamic: date, origin, dest, price, airline
  weather/
    weather_data.csv      # Dynamic: date, temp, rainfall, sunshine
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Update flight prices without touching destination data
- ✅ Add weather history without affecting costs
- ✅ Smaller files = fewer merge conflicts
- ✅ Time-series data (track trends over time)
- ✅ Clear data ownership and update schedules
- ✅ Easier to add new data sources

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 3A: Foundation (This Phase)

**Week 1: Data Structure** ⬅️ START HERE
- [ ] Create data migration script
- [ ] Generate 4 new CSV files from dummy_data.csv
- [ ] Create DataLoader class
- [ ] Update dashboard.py to use new structure
- [ ] Update all tests
- [ ] Verify outputs match original

**Week 2: Project Reorganization**
- [ ] Move phase docs to docs/project/
- [ ] Create docs/ subdirectories
- [ ] Create scripts/core/ modules
- [ ] Extract data_loader.py from dashboard.py
- [ ] Extract chart_builder.py from dashboard.py
- [ ] Update imports and tests

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaner project structure
- New data architecture
- Foundation for Streamlit (Phase 3B)

### Phase 3B: Streamlit Dashboard (Next Phase)
- Issue #9: Streamlit web app
- Issue #10: Data caching
- Issue #11: Enhanced visualizations
- (Continue with remaining issues)

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Data Structure Implementation

**Priority:** HIGH
**Time Estimate:** 2-3 days
**Why First:** Foundation for everything else

**Tasks:**
```bash
# 1. Create directory structure
mkdir -p data/{destinations,flights,weather}

# 2. Create migration script
# scripts/migrate_data.py

# 3. Run migration
python scripts/migrate_data.py

# 4. Update data loader
# scripts/core/data_loader.py

# 5. Test compatibility
pytest tests/ -v
python scripts/dashboard.py

# 6. Compare outputs
# Should match original exactly
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] 4 new CSV files created
- [ ] Data migration script works
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Dashboard output unchanged
- [ ] No functionality lost

### 2. Code Review & Approval

Before implementation:
1. Review data structure design (docs/DATA_STRUCTURE.md)
2. Approve CSV schema
3. Confirm field names and types
4. Validate migration approach

### 3. Create Implementation Issues

```bash
# Create GitHub issues for:
gh issue create --title "Implement new data structure" \
  --body "Migrate from single CSV to 4-file structure per DATA_STRUCTURE.md" \
  --milestone "v0.3.0 - Phase 3: Advanced Features" \
  --label "enhancement,priority: high"

gh issue create --title "Reorganize project structure" \
  --body "Move docs and modularize scripts per REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md" \
  --milestone "v0.3.0 - Phase 3: Advanced Features" \
  --label "refactor,priority: medium"
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Data migration breaks dashboard | Low | High | Keep old CSV, thorough testing |
| Project reorg causes import errors | Medium | High | Gradual migration, comprehensive tests |
| Team doesn't follow new processes | Medium | Medium | Clear docs, lead by example |
| Over-engineering data structure | Low | Medium | Start simple, iterate based on needs |

## Communication Plan

### For Team Review

1. **Data Structure** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Review docs/DATA_STRUCTURE.md
   - Approve CSV schema
   - Suggest improvements
   - Timeline: Decide by Oct 5

2. **Project Reorganization** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Review docs/REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
   - Approve directory structure
   - Timeline: Decide by Oct 6

3. **PR Process** (ONGOING)
   - Read docs/PR_BEST_PRACTICES.md
   - Apply to all future PRs
   - Feedback welcome

### Questions to Answer

1. **Data Structure:**
   - Do CSV field names make sense?
   - Any missing data we should capture?
   - Update frequency appropriate?

2. **Project Structure:**
   - Any concerns about reorganization?
   - Different directory names preferred?
   - Timing - do it now or wait?

3. **Implementation:**
   - Start with data structure first? (Recommended)
   - Or start with project reorg?
   - Or do both in parallel?
