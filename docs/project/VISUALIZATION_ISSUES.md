## Technical Stack

All visualizations will use:
- **Library:** Plotly for interactive charts
- **Format:** Standalone HTML files
- **Data Source:** DataLoader class
- **Output Dir:** `.build/visualizations/`
- **Styling:** Consistent with existing dashboard
- **Responsive:** Mobile-friendly layouts

## DataLoader Integration

Each visualization will load data using the DataLoader:

```python
from scripts.core.data_loader import DataLoader

loader = DataLoader()

# Individual datasets
destinations = loader.load_destinations()
costs = loader.load_costs(data_source='demo1')
flights = loader.load_flights(data_source='demo1')
weather = loader.load_weather(data_source='demo1', forecast_only=True)

# Merged view
all_data = loader.load_all(data_source='demo1')

# Aggregates
stats = loader.get_aggregates(data_source='demo1')
```

## Labels Created

- `visualization` - Data visualization and charts (color: 1d76db)
- `phase-3b` - Phase 3B: Dashboard Refactoring (color: 0e8a16)
- `phase-3c` - Phase 3C: Advanced Features (color: fbca04)
- `future` - Future enhancement or nice-to-have (color: e4e669)

## Workflow

### For Individual Issues (#17-20, #22)
1. Assign to bot or team member
2. Bot creates feature branch from develop
3. Implements visualization with tests
4. Creates PR with preview
5. Review and merge

### For Overlay Issue (#21)
1. Wait for issues #17-20 to complete
2. Review patterns from individual visualizations
3. Design unified interface
4. Implement comprehensive dashboard
5. Add cross-filtering and insights

## Benefits

### Short-term (Phase 3B)
- Explore each dataset independently
- Refine data quality
- Identify patterns and outliers
- Validate DataLoader functionality
- Create reusable visualization patterns

### Long-term (Phase 3C)
- Overlay datasets for correlations
- Find "best value" destinations
- Understand weather impact on pricing
- Cost vs location analysis
- Automated insights and recommendations

## File Structure

```

    README.md              # Documentation (issue #22)
    destinations_map.html  # Issue #17
    cost_comparison.html   # Issue #18

```

## Next Steps

1. **Assign Issues:** Distribute issues #17-22 to bots or team members
2. **Prioritize:** Focus on #17-20 and #22 first (Phase 3B)
3. **Review:** Check each visualization as they're completed
4. **Iterate:** Refine based on data insights
5. **Overlay:** Once individual views work, build #21 (Phase 3C)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All 6 issues created with detailed specs
- [x] Labels created and applied
- [ ] Issues assigned to team members
- [ ] First visualization completed (any of #17-20)
- [ ] All Phase 3B visualizations complete
- [ ] Documentation complete (#22)
- [ ] Overlay dashboard complete (#21)

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 3B Individual Views:** 15-20 hours total (parallelizable)
- **Phase 3C Overlay:** 8-10 hours (after Phase 3B)
- **Total:** 23-30 hours of development work

With parallel work on multiple issues, Phase 3B could complete in 1-2 days.

## Conclusion

These 6 issues provide a clear roadmap for creating comprehensive data visualizations. Each issue is well-scoped with detailed acceptance criteria, making them ideal for bot or team member assignment. The modular approach allows parallel development, with the overlay dashboard as the culminating feature that brings everything together.

**Status:** Issues created and ready for assignment ðŸš€
