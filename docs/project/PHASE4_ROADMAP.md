# Phase 4 Roadmap: Interactive Features & Real-Time Data

**Status:** Planning
**Target Start:** After Phase 3C completion
**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 weeks
**Priority:** Medium-High

## Overview

Phase 4 transforms the static visualization dashboards into a fully interactive web application with real-time data integration, advanced filtering, user preferences, and deployment to production.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Interactive Web Application** - Move beyond static HTML to dynamic web app
2. **Real-Time Data Integration** - Connect to live APIs for flights, weather, costs
3. **User Personalization** - Save preferences, favorites, custom filters
4. **Production Deployment** - Host on cloud platform with CI/CD
5. **Performance Optimization** - Fast loading, caching, efficient data handling

## Phase 4A: Interactive Dashboard Framework (2 weeks)

### Objectives
Migrate from static HTML to interactive framework while maintaining all Phase 3 functionality.

### Technology Decision

**Option 1: Plotly Dash (Recommended)**
- ✅ Python-based (matches current stack)
- ✅ Built for interactive dashboards
- ✅ Excellent callback system
- ✅ Can reuse existing Plotly charts
- ✅ Built-in components (dropdowns, sliders, etc.)
- ⚠️ Requires Python server
- ⚠️ Different architecture from current HTML

**Option 2: Streamlit**
- ✅ Even simpler than Dash
- ✅ Great for rapid prototyping
- ✅ Beautiful default styling
- ⚠️ Less control over layout
- ⚠️ Different state management

**Option 3: React + Plotly.js**
- ✅ Maximum flexibility
- ✅ Industry standard
- ✅ Can be static or dynamic
- ⚠️ JavaScript (different language)
- ⚠️ More complex development

**Decision:** Start with **Plotly Dash** - best balance of power and Python integration.

### Features to Implement

#### 1. Dynamic Filtering (Week 1)
- [ ] Multi-select destination dropdown
- [ ] Date range slider (Oct 5-17)
- [ ] Budget range slider ($0-$5000)
- [ ] Weather preferences (min/max temp)
- [ ] Flight preferences (max duration, direct only)
- [ ] Apply filters across all visualizations

#### 2. Interactive Components (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Click destination on map → highlight in all charts
- [ ] Hover on chart → show details in sidebar
- [ ] Select date range → update time-series
- [ ] Toggle between view modes (grid/list/map)
- [ ] Expand/collapse chart sections

#### 3. State Management (Week 2)
- [ ] Persist filters in URL query params

- Filters update all charts < 500ms
- Zero regression in functionality
- Deployment-ready application

## Phase 4B: Real-Time Data Integration (1-2 weeks)

### Objectives
Replace static CSV data with live API connections for current information.

### Data Sources

#### 1. Flight Data APIs
**Primary Options:**
- **Skyscanner API** (Recommended)
  - Comprehensive flight search
  - Real-time pricing
  - Multiple airlines
  - Rate limits: ~50 requests/minute

- **Amadeus API**
  - Professional-grade data
  - Good documentation
  - Free tier available

- **Kayak/Google Flights** (via scraping)
  - Most up-to-date prices
  - No official API (risky)

**Implementation:**
```python
# scripts/data/flight_api.py
class FlightDataFetcher:
    def fetch_prices(self, origin, destinations, date_range):
        # Call Skyscanner API
        # Cache results for 1 hour
        # Return standardized DataFrame
```

#### 2. Weather Data APIs
**Primary Options:**
- **OpenWeatherMap** (Recommended)
  - Free tier: 1000 calls/day
  - 7-day forecast
  - Historical data available

- **WeatherAPI.com**
  - 1M calls/month free
  - Better forecast accuracy

**Implementation:**
```python
# scripts/data/weather_api.py
class WeatherDataFetcher:
    def fetch_forecast(self, destinations, days=7):
        # Call OpenWeatherMap API
        # Cache for 6 hours
        # Return standardized DataFrame
```

#### 3. Cost of Living APIs
**Primary Options:**
- **Numbeo API**
  - Most comprehensive
  - Paid tiers only

- **Teleport Public API**
  - Free
  - Limited cities

- **Web Scraping** (fallback)
  - Scrape Numbeo public pages
  - Update monthly

**Implementation:**
```python
# scripts/data/cost_api.py
class CostDataFetcher:
    def fetch_costs(self, destinations):
        # Call Teleport API
        # Cache for 30 days (costs change slowly)
        # Return standardized DataFrame
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Flight prices:** 1-6 hours (frequently changing)
- **Weather forecasts:** 6-12 hours (moderate changes)
- **Cost of living:** 30 days (rarely changes)
- **Destinations data:** Static (no caching needed)

### Features to Implement
- [ ] API client classes for each data source

### Success Metrics
- API response time < 2 seconds
- Cache hit rate > 80%
- Zero API key exposure
- Graceful degradation on API failures
