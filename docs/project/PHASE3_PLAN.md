- [ ] Add page routing (Home, Charts, About)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Streamlit app runs locally without errors
- Both existing charts display correctly
- Basic filters work and update charts
- Clean, professional UI layout
- Mobile-responsive design

**Technical Notes:**

- [ ] Profile application performance
- [ ] Optimize DataFrame operations
- [ ] Add loading spinners for async operations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Data loads from cache after first load
- Cache expires after reasonable TTL (e.g., 24 hours)

### Issue #13: Database Backend (SQLite)
**Priority:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days
**Branch:** `feature/database-backend`

**Objective:** Add SQLite database for persistent data storage and faster queries.
