# Project Build Summary

## Overview
The Places2Go destination dashboard project has been successfully built out with industry-standard configurations and best practices.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Dependency Management**
- Created `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies:
  - Core: pandas, plotly, python-dotenv
  - Testing: pytest, pytest-cov
  - Development: black, flake8

### 2. **Git Configuration**
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` for Python projects
- Ignores: virtual environments, cache files, IDE configs, output files, environment variables

### 3. **Project Configuration**
- Created `pyproject.toml` with:
  - Project metadata (name, version, description, license)
  - Build system configuration
  - pytest configuration with coverage reporting
  - Black formatter settings
  - Coverage reporting rules

### 4. **Bug Fixes**
- Fixed path bug in `tests/test_data.py` (changed `parents[2]` to `parents[1]`)
- Tests now correctly locate the data files

### 5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions
- Automated testing on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
- Includes: flake8 linting, black formatting checks, pytest with coverage
- Optional Codecov integration for coverage tracking

### 6. **Environment Variables**
- Created `.env.example` template for future API key configuration
- Prepared for: weather API, flight API, database connections

### 7. **License**
- Added MIT License for open-source distribution
- Project is ready for public GitHub hosting

### 8. **Testing**
- All tests pass successfully ✅
- 2 tests covering data loading and validation
- Coverage reporting enabled (currently 44% - room for improvement)

## 📊 Test Results
```
tests/test_data.py::test_load_data_types PASSED
tests/test_data.py::test_load_data_columns PASSED
2 passed in 3.83s
